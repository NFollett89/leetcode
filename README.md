# Leetcode by Nick Follett
- As it has become the "Gold Standard" for SWE-style interviewing, I need to familiarize with the platform and start learning various techniques and algorithms which don't often come up as a Systems/Cloud/Reliability Engineer
- I make an effort to balance readability with performance
- I make an effort to record my intuition on the problem, or what helped me approach my solution
- Often my solution will incorporate some part of another submitted solution I've learned from. These solutions should not be viewed as wholly original work.
